# InstagramDataParser
A simple javascript tool that parses account data downloaded from Instagram.
I have created it because I couldn't find online tool to export a list of followers for free.

Currently this tool only supports parsing data about followers, following, non-followers, sent follow requests, close friends.
It works offline and it requires you to download your data manually, but it doesn't interact with Instagram in any way, thus making it unable to detect third party software usage (which reduces risk of getting banned).

It should work on any platform, but is designed for desktop machines. Developing it for mobile would only require css editing to fit smaller screens. It was tested on Brave 1.18.77 (Chromium: 87.0.4280.101 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Firefox 84.0.1 (64-bit) and Opera 73.0.3856.284. I didn't find bugs so please report them if you find any.
